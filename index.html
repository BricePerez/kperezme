I am always learning from various online resources, video tutorials, and books to increase my knowledge and familiarity with new technology. I drown myself in countless hours of learning videos from Lynda.com, to Pluralsight and Safari Books Online to understand solutions to Big Data challenges. I am not afraid to speak in front of a crowd. I have a love for the visual arts, photography and a growing interest in free-hand drawing.
